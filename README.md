# Genie ðŸ§ž

Genie is a lightweight, fast personal version control system.
It tracks file changes using metadata (size + mtime), making commits and status nearâ€‘instant even on large projects.
Comes with a simple web dashboard and a global registry of your projects.

## Features
	â€¢	Instant status/commits via file metadata (no hashing)
	â€¢	SQLite-backed commit history per project in .genie/
	â€¢	Glob-based .genieignore (powered by globset)
	â€¢	Web dashboard at http://localhost:2718 (or choose a port)
	â€¢	Global registry of projects at ~/.genie/registry.json
	â€¢	New commands for welcome, docs, completions, man page, and self-update

## Installation

Pick one:

1) One-line installer (from GitHub releases)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imisbahk/genie/main/install.sh | bash
```

2) Cargo install (build from source)

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

3) Manual copy/symlink from local build

```bash
cargo build --release
sudo cp target/release/genie /usr/local/bin/genie
# or
sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/target/release/genie" /usr/local/bin/genie
```

## Usage

```

The UI will be available at http://localhost:<port>

	â€¢	Hotspot file detection
	â€¢	Space-efficient snapshots
	â€¢	Experimental time-based branching
